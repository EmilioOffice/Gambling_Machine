# Gambling Machine in Python

This repository is part of my formative years as a Software Engineering student. It showcases the implementation of problem-solving techniques, analytical thinking, and the business logic behind a casino gambling machine. The primary goal of this project is **educational practice** and **skill acquisition**â€”it is **not** intended to promote or endorse gambling.

> **Disclaimer**: I am not supporting or encouraging gambling. Using this code is under your own consideration and responsibility.
